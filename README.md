## ðŸ›  Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Supabase CLI (install via `npm install -g supabase`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Reposible-tc/tc-foundation-template.git
   cd tc-foundation-template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Environment Variables

1. Create a .env file in the project root.

2. Copy the example:

```bash
cp .example.env .env
```

3. Fill in the required variables in .env

### Running the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## ðŸ§¬ Supabase Setup

Instructions for working with Supabase in local and remote development.

### Generating Supabase Types

Keep your TypeScript types in sync with your database schema:

```bash
# For a local Supabase instance
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > ./src/lib/supabase/types.ts

# For a remote Supabase project
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> > ./src/lib/supabase/types.ts
```

These commands generate types.ts under src/lib/supabase/types.ts based on your schema.

### Database Migrations & Deployment

1. Link Your Supabase Project

```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```

2. Pull Remote Schema Changes (if any)

```bash
npx supabase db pull --schema auth,storage
```

Review the generated migration file in supabase/migrations/.

3. Create a New Migration

```bash
npx supabase db diff --file <NAME_OF_MIGRATION>
```

Tip: Review and test all migrations carefully before pushing to production.
Refer to the Supabase CLI documentation for advanced usage.

4. Apply & Reset Migrations Locally

```bash
# Apply migrations
npx supabase migration up

# (Optional) Reset local database
npx supabase db reset
```

5. Deploy to Remote

```bash
npx supabase db push
```

This will deploy your local migrations to the remote Supabase instance, keeping both environments in sync.
